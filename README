RRB-trees

Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees.

This library, unmodified, depends on automake tools and Boehm GC. On
Debian-based distros, you can install the automake tools through:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf gnu-standards\
                       autoconf-doc libtool gettext autoconf-archive

and Boehm GC through:
  sudo apt-get install libgc-dev libgc1c2

To build and install the library, perform the following calls:
  autoreconf --install
  CFLAGS='-Ofast' ./configure
  make
  make check ## but only if you want to
  sudo make install

The `sudo make install` call should return a message which tells you where the
library has been installed (usually `/usr/local/lib`). Now, to check that the
installation went successfully, you try to compile one of the test suite
programs on its own:
  cd test-suite
  gcc -o testy test_concat.c -std=c11 -lrrb -lgc
  ./testy # should work fine
    
If you want to uninstall the library, do `sudo make uninstall` in the same
directory. (You have to ./configure it first though.)
